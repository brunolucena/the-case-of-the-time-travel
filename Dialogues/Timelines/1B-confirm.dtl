narrator: Ah yes, Introduction to Quantum Theory, The Emergent Multiverse, The Gentleman’s Guide to Statistics and Probabilities. All the old classics.
narrator: Elonai has a few as well. The Time Machine, The Left Hand of Darkness, Solaris. I was never sure why she wasted so much time on silly pulps, but you must forgive your love some tresspasses.
narrator: Hmm… one book is left out on the table. Galapagos by Kurt Vonnegut. Oh yes, she mentioned that once. It was about… a seal, or something? Ah, I’ve wasted my time here, and found nothing.
