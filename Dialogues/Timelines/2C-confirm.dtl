narrator: I sneak around through the crowd, none noticing that I am the same man as the Everett nervously presenting his invention. Good, I must stay and wait until my moment…
narrator: There! I see a cloaked figure sneaking through. He’s going straight for Elonai! Stop rogue!
narrator: I pull out my gun, and before he can shoot— Bang!
narrator: Elonai screams. Oh god, I missed, oh god I hit her! The cloaked figure turns, a look of shock across his face.
narrator: His familiar face.
narrator: Like I am looking in the mirror.
narrator: No, no, this is all wrong, I’m not—how can I be the murderer? No, I have to go back, try again.
